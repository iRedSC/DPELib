### Making functions

Function files are essentially just a list of commands, like using chain command blocks.

You can make comments by prepending the line with a `#`, which will make minecraft ignore that line.
```mcfunction
# this is a comment and will be ignored
say this command will run first
say this command will be run next
```
The file extension for functions is `.mcfunction`
